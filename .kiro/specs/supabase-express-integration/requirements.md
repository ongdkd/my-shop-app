# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Next.js POS application currently uses local storage and mock data for product management, orders, and POS terminal configurations. To enable real-world usage, multi-user support, and data persistence, we need to integrate Supabase as the database backend with Express.js as the API layer. This will transform the application from a prototype to a production-ready system with proper data management, user authentication, and scalable architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want my product data, orders, and POS configurations to be stored in a persistent database, so that data is not lost when the application restarts or when multiple users access the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN products are added, edited, or deleted THEN the system SHALL store changes in Supabase database
2. WHEN orders are created THEN the system SHALL persist order data with proper relationships to products and POS terminals
3. WHEN POS terminal configurations are updated THEN the system SHALL save settings to the database
4. WHEN the application restarts THEN the system SHALL load all data from the database without data loss
5. WHEN multiple users access the system THEN the system SHALL show consistent data across all sessions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a well-structured Express.js API backend, so that the frontend can communicate with the database through RESTful endpoints with proper error handling and validation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend needs product data THEN the system SHALL provide REST API endpoints for CRUD operations
2. WHEN API requests are made THEN the system SHALL validate input data and return appropriate HTTP status codes
3. WHEN database errors occur THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and return meaningful error messages
4. WHEN API endpoints are called THEN the system SHALL use proper authentication and authorization
5. WHEN concurrent requests are made THEN the system SHALL handle them safely without data corruption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper database schema design with relationships, so that data integrity is maintained and queries are efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the database THEN the system SHALL create tables for products, orders, order_items (order details), pos_terminals, customers, and users
2. WHEN creating relationships THEN the system SHALL use foreign keys to maintain referential integrity
3. WHEN storing product data THEN the system SHALL include fields for barcode, name, price, image_url, category, and stock
4. WHEN recording orders THEN the system SHALL track order_date, total_amount, pos_terminal_id, payment_method, and customer information
5. WHEN storing order details THEN the system SHALL record each line item with product_id, quantity, unit_price, and line_total
6. WHEN managing POS terminals THEN the system SHALL store terminal_name, location, and configuration settings
7. WHEN querying order history THEN the system SHALL provide complete order details including all purchased items

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the existing frontend components to seamlessly integrate with the new backend API, so that the user experience remains consistent while gaining database persistence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing components load data THEN the system SHALL replace localStorage calls with API calls
2. WHEN the product management interface is used THEN the system SHALL work with real database operations
3. WHEN the POS interface processes orders THEN the system SHALL save orders to the database via API
4. WHEN the admin dashboard displays data THEN the system SHALL fetch real-time data from the database
5. WHEN barcode scanning adds products THEN the system SHALL verify products exist in the database

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want user authentication and authorization, so that only authorized personnel can access admin functions and manage the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access admin functions THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN users log in THEN the system SHALL use Supabase Auth for secure authentication
3. WHEN different user roles exist THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access control
4. WHEN API endpoints are accessed THEN the system SHALL verify user permissions
5. WHEN sessions expire THEN the system SHALL handle authentication renewal gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want detailed order tracking with line items, so that I can see exactly what was purchased in each transaction for inventory management and reporting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an order is created THEN the system SHALL store each product as a separate order_item record
2. WHEN viewing order history THEN the system SHALL display complete order details with all line items
3. WHEN calculating order totals THEN the system SHALL sum all line item totals accurately
4. WHEN products are scanned at POS THEN the system SHALL create order_items with current product prices
5. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide detailed sales data by product and time period

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper environment configuration and deployment setup, so that the application can run in development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up environments THEN the system SHALL use environment variables for database connections
2. WHEN deploying the Express backend THEN the system SHALL be deployable alongside the Next.js frontend
3. WHEN configuring Supabase THEN the system SHALL use proper connection strings and API keys
4. WHEN running in different environments THEN the system SHALL use appropriate database instances
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL use secure connection methods and proper CORS settings
