# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The POS Terminal Management page currently shows a "Running in Demo Mode" warning and falls back to sample data when the backend API is not available or not properly connected. This feature aims to ensure the POS Terminal Management page is fully integrated with the database through the backend API, removing demo mode behavior and providing proper error handling and user feedback.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the POS Terminal Management page to always connect to the database through the backend API, so that all terminal data is persistent and synchronized across the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the admin accesses the POS Terminal Management page THEN the system SHALL fetch POS terminals from the database via the backend API
2. WHEN the backend API is available THEN the system SHALL NOT display any "demo mode" or "fallback data" warnings
3. WHEN POS terminal data is loaded from the database THEN the system SHALL display real terminal configurations including names, colors, and active status
4. IF no POS terminals exist in the database THEN the system SHALL display an empty state with an option to create the first terminal
5. WHEN the API client returns fallback data (terminals with id "pos1", "pos2", "pos3") THEN the system SHALL treat this as an API connection failure and display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want proper error handling when the backend API is unavailable, so that I understand the system status and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend API is completely unavailable THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the connection issue
2. WHEN the API connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable options like "Retry Connection" and "Check System Status"
3. WHEN there are authentication issues with the API THEN the system SHALL redirect to login or display appropriate auth error messages
4. WHEN API requests timeout THEN the system SHALL show loading states and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want all POS terminal CRUD operations to work seamlessly with the database, so that changes are immediately persisted and reflected across all connected systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I create a new POS terminal THEN the system SHALL save it to the database and immediately reflect the change without requiring a page refresh
2. WHEN I update a POS terminal's name or theme color THEN the system SHALL persist the changes to the database and update the UI in real-time
3. WHEN I toggle a POS terminal's active status THEN the system SHALL update the database and notify other connected POS terminals of the status change
4. WHEN I delete a POS terminal THEN the system SHALL perform a soft delete in the database and remove it from the UI immediately

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want the system to validate that the backend API and database are properly configured, so that I can identify and resolve configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL perform a health check on the backend API connection
2. WHEN the database connection is not configured THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages about missing environment variables or database setup
3. WHEN Supabase authentication is not properly configured THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on authentication setup
4. WHEN the API endpoints return unexpected responses THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring of POS terminal operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POS terminal operations succeed THEN the system SHALL log successful operations with relevant details
2. WHEN POS terminal operations fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information including request/response data
3. WHEN the system detects API connectivity issues THEN it SHALL log connection status and retry attempts
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL log auth-related errors without exposing sensitive information
