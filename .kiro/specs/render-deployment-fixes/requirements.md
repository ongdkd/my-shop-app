# Render Deployment Fixes - Requirements

## Introduction

The backend builds successfully locally but fails to build on Render.com. This spec addresses the environment-specific issues that prevent successful deployment on Render's platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Successful Render Build

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to build successfully on Render, so that the API can be deployed and accessible online.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the code is pushed to the main branch THEN Render SHALL successfully build the backend without errors
2. WHEN the build process runs on Render THEN all TypeScript files SHALL compile correctly
3. WHEN dependencies are installed on Render THEN all required packages SHALL be available
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the dist folder SHALL contain all compiled JavaScript files
5. WHEN the build process finishes THEN the application SHALL start successfully

### Requirement 2: Environment Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent behavior between local and Render environments, so that there are no deployment surprises.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building locally THEN the same Node.js version SHALL be used as on Render
2. WHEN TypeScript compiles locally THEN the same configuration SHALL work on Render
3. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN the same versions SHALL be used in both environments
4. WHEN build scripts execute THEN they SHALL behave identically in both environments

### Requirement 3: Render-Specific Optimizations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Render-specific build optimizations, so that deployment is reliable and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building on Render THEN the build process SHALL complete within time limits
2. WHEN using Render's environment THEN proper memory management SHALL be implemented
3. WHEN deploying to Render THEN appropriate logging SHALL be available for debugging
4. WHEN the build fails THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided for troubleshooting
