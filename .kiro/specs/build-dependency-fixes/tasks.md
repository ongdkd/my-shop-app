# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Verify and diagnose current dependency state


  - Run dependency audit commands to identify missing packages
  - Check node_modules directory structure for autoprefixer and related packages
  - Document current package.json vs installed packages discrepancies
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1_




- [ ] 2. Clean and reinstall all dependencies
  - Remove node_modules directory and package-lock.json file
  - Run fresh npm install to ensure all dependencies are properly installed
  - Verify autoprefixer, postcss, and tailwindcss are installed in node_modules
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.1, 3.1, 3.3_

- [ ] 3. Validate PostCSS configuration compatibility
  - Check postcss.config.mjs syntax and plugin references
  - Ensure all referenced plugins (tailwindcss, autoprefixer) are available
  - Test PostCSS configuration by running a simple CSS processing test
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_

- [ ] 4. Test development build process
  - Start Next.js development server with npm run dev


  - Check for any CSS processing errors or warnings in console
  - Verify Tailwind CSS classes are being processed correctly
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 2.3, 4.1_

- [ ] 5. Test production build process
  - Run npm run build to test full production build
  - Verify build completes without webpack or CSS processing errors
  - Check that .next/static directory is generated with CSS assets
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 6. Verify CSS output and optimization
  - Inspect generated CSS files for proper vendor prefixes from autoprefixer
  - Confirm Tailwind CSS utilities are properly compiled and purged
  - Test that CSS loads correctly in production build
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.2, 4.3_

- [ ] 7. Create build verification script
  - Write a Node.js script to check for required dependencies before build
  - Add script to package.json for easy dependency verification
  - Include checks for autoprefixer, postcss, and tailwindcss availability
  - _Requirements: 3.2, 3.3_

- [ ] 8. Test deployment readiness
  - Run production build and start commands to simulate deployment
  - Verify all CSS assets load correctly in production mode
  - Test that the application starts without CSS-related errors
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_

- [ ] 9. Update documentation and prevent future issues
  - Update README.md with dependency installation instructions
  - Document the required Node.js and npm versions in package.json engines field
  - Add troubleshooting section for common build dependency issues
  - _Requirements: 3.3_
