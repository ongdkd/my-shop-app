# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Next.js POS application is currently failing to build due to missing CSS processing dependencies, specifically `autoprefixer` which is required for Tailwind CSS and Next.js CSS processing. This issue prevents successful deployment and production builds. We need to identify and install all missing dependencies to ensure the build process completes successfully.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Next.js application to build successfully, so that I can deploy it to production without errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm run build` THEN the system SHALL complete the build process without dependency errors
2. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL have all required CSS processing dependencies installed
3. WHEN using Tailwind CSS THEN the system SHALL have autoprefixer properly configured and available
4. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL generate optimized CSS without missing module errors

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all PostCSS dependencies to be properly installed, so that CSS processing works correctly during development and build.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application uses Tailwind CSS THEN the system SHALL have autoprefixer installed as a dependency
2. WHEN PostCSS processes CSS files THEN the system SHALL have all required PostCSS plugins available
3. WHEN running in development mode THEN the system SHALL process CSS without missing dependency warnings
4. WHEN the postcss.config.mjs file is present THEN the system SHALL have all referenced plugins installed

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the package.json to include all necessary dependencies, so that fresh installations work without manual dependency resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npm install` on a fresh clone THEN the system SHALL install all required dependencies
2. WHEN checking package.json THEN the system SHALL list autoprefixer in dependencies or devDependencies
3. WHEN other developers clone the project THEN the system SHALL build successfully after npm install
4. WHEN CI/CD processes run THEN the system SHALL have reproducible builds with locked dependency versions

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify that the build fix resolves all related issues, so that deployment can proceed successfully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the missing dependencies are installed THEN the system SHALL complete `npm run build` successfully
2. WHEN running the build command THEN the system SHALL generate the .next/static directory with optimized assets
3. WHEN testing the production build THEN the system SHALL start without CSS-related errors
4. WHEN deploying to Render.com THEN the system SHALL build successfully in the deployment environment
