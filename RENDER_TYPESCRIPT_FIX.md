# Issue: Build Failed on Render Due to Missing TypeScript Dependency

## Problem
**Error**: "This is not the tsc command you are looking for"
**Cause**: TypeScript was only in devDependencies, but Render needs it in regular dependencies for build process

## Solution Applied ✅
1. **Moved TypeScript to dependencies**: Added `typescript` and `@types/node` to regular dependencies
2. **Simplified build command**: Changed to `npx tsc` 
3. **Added build validation**: Postbuild script confirms successful compilation

## Files Modified
- `backend/package.json` - Moved TypeScript to dependencies, simplified build scripts

## Expected Result
Render build will now succeed because:
- `npm ci` installs TypeScript as a regular dependency
- `npx tsc` can find the TypeScript compiler
- Build validation confirms successful compilation

## Deployment Status
✅ **READY FOR DEPLOYMENT** - Commit and push to trigger Render rebuild
